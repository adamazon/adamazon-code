# Influencing factors of product's reviews

**Group:** Victor Le, Quentin de Longraye, Karttikeya Mangalam

## Abstract
Product's review are often in the middle of polemical situations, because of the
high subjectivity it could bring. The review can also be faked, exaggerated or
influenced by others (see the [social proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof)).
The main purpose of this project is to understand which factors can influence online
product's review and at which degree. This includes rating history for a single product, but also rating
history of an individual or metadata about the product itself, including extracted
information about product's picture, such as its color. Based on these factors,
the objective will be to find out if an evaluation's range can be predicted or
not, and with which level of effectiveness. The Amazon's review dataset will be
used for the analysis.

## Research questions
- Which factors can influence an online product review?
- Can a review's score be predicted based on product metadata and reviews?
- Can subjectivity of an evaluation be outlined from other's evaluations and
  product category?
- Can the next review score of an evaluator for a specific product be
  anticipated, based on its review history and the product itself?

## Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

- Amazon's review: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/
  - Using the cluster, we will extract the most evaluated products and some of the
    most productive evaluators to provide our analysis.
