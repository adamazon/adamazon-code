# Influencing factors of product's reviews

# Abstract
Product's review are often in the middle of polemical situations, because of the
high subjectivity it could bring. The review can also be faked, exageratated or
influenced by others (see the [social proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof)).
The main purpose of this project is to understand which factors can influence online
product's review and at which degree. This include rating history for a single product, but also rating
history of an individual or metadata about the product itself, including extracted
information about product's picture, such as its color. Based on these factors,
the objective will be to find out if an evaluation's range can be predicted or
not, and with wich level of effectiveness. The Amazon's review dataset will be
used for the analysis.
